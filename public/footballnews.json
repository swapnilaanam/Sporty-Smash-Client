        "description": "In football, a penalty kick is a critical moment that can sway the fate of a match. When a defensive foul occurs inside the penalty area, the attacking team is awarded a chance to take a shot on goal from the penalty spot, located 12 yards away from the net. Only one player, usually the one fouled, is permitted to take the kick. The goalkeeper must stay on the goal line until the ball is kicked, while other players must remain outside the penalty area and arc. Once the referee signals for the kick, the ball is in play as soon as it's struck, and if the ball crosses the goal line between the posts and under the crossbar, a goal is scored. Penalty kicks demand nerves of steel from the penalty taker, and the outcome can be influenced by the goalkeeper's anticipation and quick reflexes. These high-pressure moments often leave fans holding their breath and have the potential to become iconic highlights in the history of the sport."
